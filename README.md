# Real World ARG: Your Privacy-First GameFi Platform üåçüéÆ

Real World ARG is an innovative GameFi platform that empowers creators to design immersive **ARG (Alternate Reality Game)** experiences that require real-world task completion. What sets this platform apart is its foundation on **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, which ensures that player privacy is protected throughout their journey. This project merges the excitement of geolocation-based challenges with cutting-edge encryption to create groundbreaking, privacy-sensitive gameplay.

## Tackling the Privacy Dilemma

In today's gaming landscape, players often have to compromise their privacy when engaging in real-life activities tied to gaming experiences. Traditional ARGs can demand extensive personal information, leaving participants vulnerable to breaches and misuse of their data. This is especially critical as interactions move to more public and varied environments, where sensitive information is at stake. Real World ARG addresses these concerns by utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to verify player actions without exposing their identity or personal data.

## How FHE Revolutionizes Player Interaction

By leveraging **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, Real World ARG provides a robust solution for maintaining player privacy. Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, meaning that clues and task completions can be processed while being hidden from unauthorized access. This ensures that players can engage fully in activities without the fear of their personal information being compromised, paving the way for a new era of secure gaming.

## Core Functionalities üîë

Real World ARG stands out with its unique set of features:

- **FHE Encrypted Clues**: All clues related to real-world tasks are encrypted using FHE, ensuring that only authorized participants can access them.
  
- **DePIN Privacy Verification**: The platform utilizes DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) technology to confirm task completion while safeguarding user privacy.

- **Immersive Gameplay**: Merges the excitement of ARGs with FHE, creating a layer of security that enhances user trust.

- **Mobile App Client**: A user-friendly mobile application that allows players to participate in tasks seamlessly, paired with a game creation editor for creators to design new challenges.

- **Global Reach**: Supports global geolocation features, allowing for worldwide participation in various ARG missions.

## Technology Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

The backbone of Real World ARG is built on a combination of robust technologies:

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Core library enabling fully homomorphic encryption for secure data operations.
- **Node.js**: For the server-side application logic.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for deploying Ethereum-based smart contracts.
- **React Native**: For crafting cross-platform mobile applications to enhance user experience.
- **Solidity**: The programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. ![Caution] **Do not use `git clone` or any repository URLs** to download this project; ensure you have the latest version of the files and directories as provided by your source.

## Build & Run Instructions üöÄ

To compile and test the Real World ARG project, use the following commands in your terminal:

1. Compile the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Run tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

4. For the mobile application, ensure your development environment is set for React Native and run:

   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

### Code Snippet üìù

Here‚Äôs a simple example of a function that encrypts a clue using the Zama FHE SDK:

```javascript
const { FHE } = require('zama-fhe-sdk');

async function createEncryptedClue(clue) {
    const encryptedClue = await FHE.encrypt(clue);
    return encryptedClue;
}

// Usage
const clue = "Find the treasure hidden near the old oak tree.";
createEncryptedClue(clue).then(encrypted => {
    console.log("Encrypted Clue:", encrypted);
});
```
